# RandomCircularListGenerator
### Created by Chase Carnaroli
The program takes a list of names from multiple groups of people and generates a circular linked list where no two people from the same group are next to each other.

#### Background
Every year, my high school volleyball team would play a game called "*The Assasination Game*" (TAG for short).
Everyone in the volleyball program would play together: Varsity, JV, Novice, and Stat Keepers.

Here's how it worked. Everyone would get a name of someone else in the program. This person was their target.
In order to "assasinate" your target, you had to sneak up behind them, without being seen, and grab their shoulder.
Once you "assasinate" your target, they give you the name of their target, and this is who you go after next.

The people in the game are in one big circular list.
In order to win, you have to make your way through the circular list until you get to the person who is hunting you.

If you assasinate the person hunting you, then that means you are the last person left and you just won.  
You win when you are the last person alive.

The one other thing about the game is that your first target was never someone on your own team.
It was always someone from a different team in the program.
This was so that you would have to get to know kids at different levels and it worked!
The game was a great team bonding experience.

It was a pain for my coach to set up though, because he had about 50 names that he to randomly mix into a circular list with no two players on the same team being next to eachother.

I created this program to automate that process. 
All coach has to do now is put in a list of names and it will generate the circular list for him!

*Ps: I won the game my sophmore year and got 2nd place my senior year, so I was pretty good ;)*

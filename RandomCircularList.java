/** RandomCircularListGenerator
 *  @author Chase Carnaroli
 *
 *  Creates a circular list of players.
 *  The list is essentially a linked list. Each person is a node.
 *  Each person class is assigned a target, so it knows who the next node is
 *
 *  No two players on the same team will be directly next to eachother on the list (unless only one team is inputed)
 *
 *  INSTANCE VARIABLES
 *      List<Team> teams        // list teams that will included in the circular list
 *      Person firstPeron       // considered the "starting" point for the circular list
 *
 *  METHODS
 *      assignTargets()                                 // creates the circlular linked list, telling each person who its next target is
 *      copyListOfTeams(List<Team>) -> List<Team>       // return copy of a list of teams
 *      randomlySelectTeam(List<Team>)                  // randomly selects team form a list of teams
 *      removeRandomPerson(Team)                        // randomly selects, removes, and returns a person from a team
 *      removeRandomPerson(List<Team>)                  // randomly selects, removes, and returns a person from a random team in a list of teams
 *      getLastPerson() -> Person                       // returns last person in the list
 *      printFirstTargets()                             // prints to console a list of everyone's first target.
 *                                                              Ex: One "Person -> Target" per line
 *      printList()                                     // prints to console a list of everyone and who they are targeting
 *                                                              Ex: "x --> y --> z --> a --> b --> c --> x"
 *      printTeam(Team)                                 // prints to console a list of the team's players
 *                                                              Ex: "TeamName/n - name1 /n -name2 /n" etc
 *      printAllTeams()                                 // runs printTeam(Team) method for all teams in the list
 *      getNumPeople() -> int                           // returns number of people in the game
 *      getNumPeopleInList() -> int                     // returns number of people in the list
